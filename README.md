# Cludo Technical Assignment
 
### Background
I chose the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development website for several reasons. I’ve used their search function several times over the last few years and I’ve never been happy about the experience. In addition to prior personal frustration, I also think they are perfect client for Cludo.

I started by first doing some brief research with several searches. I also spoke with a few friends that work at DEED to get their perspective and insight. I learned that the ineffective search caused several problems including causing an abundance of calls to their main phone number.
I thought

### Primary Enhancements
1. Cludo’s Search-as-you-type functionality would be perfect for an organization of this size. This feature would help DEED better direct their users to the content they are looking for, especially with the popular searches.
I’ve updated the filter feature to allow users to delineate between webpages and documents. Currently, DEED’s filter is unhelpful and doesn’t.

2. Custom Banners with important relevant information would also drastically improve the user search experience. Currently, DEED’s search can provide outdated and confusing results.ike the office contact information box in my example, a banner can provide users a convenient way to get important information and take action.

3. Breadcrumb links at the bottom of each result would also enhance a user’s experience. DEED currently has a fairly intuitive navigation structure and I think adding breadcrumbs will let the user know the location of the information they are looking for. For example, if a search result is a document, a user would be able to navigate to the page the document is located in. Currently, users are only able to open or download documents without the needed context like whether or not the document is outdated.

### Secondary Enhancements
4. I’ve updated the typography of the page to allow for a more visually appealing display. For example, I’ve updated the font colors and added borders between results to improve readability. I’ve also added subtle colors to documents so they stand out more and allow users to easily see the difference between document results and web pages. I also updated the search input area to make it more inviting.

5. I’ve simplified the displayed details from the web pages that come up as search results. Currently, both the first few lines of text and a separate summary of page contents are displayed which makes each result messy. I’ve simplified this by only displaying the page summary as they look pretty accurate and help users understand what is on that search result page
