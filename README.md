# Cludo Technical Assignment
 
### Background
I chose the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED) website for several reasons. I have used their search function several times over the last few years and I have never been happy with the experience. In addition to prior personal frustration, I also think DEED is the perfect client for Cludo.

I first did some brief research by running several searches. I also spoke with a few friends that work at DEED to get their perspective and insight, who shared that the ineffective search function caused several problems, including an abundance of calls to their main phone number.

### Static Webpage Example

### Primary Enhancements
1. Cludo’s Search-as-you-type functionality would be perfect for an organization of this size. This feature would help DEED better direct their users to the content they are looking for, especially with popular searches. I updated the filter feature to allow users to delineate between webpages and documents. 

2. Custom Banners with important relevant information would also drastically improve the user search experience. Currently, DEED’s search can provide outdated and confusing results. I included an office contact information banner in my example, which demonstrates that, with Cludo's help, DEED could provide users a convenient way to get important information and take action.

3. Breadcrumb links at the bottom of each result would also enhance a user’s experience. Overall, DEED currently has a fairly intuitive navigation structure. The search function, however, provides users with the ability to open or download documents that appear as search results without informing them of the full context. This can lead to users relying on outdated documents or having trouble finding related documents, to name a few issues. Breadcrumb links would allow a user to follow the document's path back to the page it initially linked from.

### Secondary Enhancements
4. I updated the typography of the page, including changing the font colors and adding borders between results, to allow for a more readbale and visually appealing display. I also added subtle colors to document icons so they stand out more and allow users to easily see the difference between document results and web pages. I also made the search input area more inviting.

5. I simplified the displayed details from the web pages that come up as search results. Currently, both the first few lines of text and a separate summary of page contents are displayed, which makes each result look messy. I simplified this by only displaying the page summaries, as they look to be accurate descriptions and can help users understand what is on the search result pages.
